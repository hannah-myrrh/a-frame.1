# a-frame.1

# A-Frame Starter Project  
A simple WebVR/WebXR scene built with **A-Frame** and served using a lightweight Node.js static file server.  
This project includes custom textures (brick, metal, rusty grid) and demonstrates how to organize assets, components, and scene files.

## Features
- A-Frame 1.5.0 (WebVR/WebXR)
- Custom textures mapped onto 3D objects
- Spinning component written in JavaScript
- Organized `/assets/` folder for textures and future models
- Minimal Node.js server for local development


## Running the Project

1. Install dependencies (none required)
2. Start the local server:
```bash
node server.js

3. Open the scene in your browser:
http://localhost:3000

Your A-Frame project should now be running locally.
